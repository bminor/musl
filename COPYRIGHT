Most of the math library code (src/math/*) is Copyright © 1993 Sun

labelled as such. All have been licensed under extremely permissive
terms which are compatible with the GNU LGPL. See the comments in the

All files which have no copyright comments are original works
Copyright © 2005-2011 Rich Felker, the main author of this library.
The decision to exclude such comments is intentional, as it should be
possible to carry around the complete source code on tiny storage
media. All public header files (include/*) should be treated as Public
Domain as they intentionally contain no content which can be covered
by copyright. Some source modules may fall in this category as well.
If you believe that a file is so trivial that it should be in the
Public Domain, please contact me and, if I agree, I will explicitly
release it from copyright.
